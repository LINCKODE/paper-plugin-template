# Linckode's Paper Plugin Template

> This project template allows you to easily create a Paper plugin using Gradle.

## Internal Minecraft classes
Access to Minecraft's internal classes is provided using the Paperweight Userdev Gradle plugin.  
The plugin allows you to use Minecraft's classes directly in your project without the need to depend on CraftBukkit.  
The Minecraft classes use the official Mojang mappings, and references to them will automatically be re-obfuscated at compile time using the `reobfJar` gradle task.

> See https://docs.papermc.io/paper/dev/userdev for more information.

## paper-plugin.yml
The `paper-plugin.yml` file is automatically generated by the plugin-yml Gradle plugin.  
An example configuration is provided in the `paper` block of `build.gradle`.
